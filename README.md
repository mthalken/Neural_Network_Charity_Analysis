# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## The purpose of this analysis was to create a Neural Network Model to analyze and help predict which organizations would make good investment opportunities. 

## Project Overview:
1. Use preprocessing to prepare the data for a neural network model
2. Compile, train, and evaluate the model
3. Optimize the model


## Resources
- Source of data: [charity_data.csv](https://github.com/mthalken/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/blob/main/data/charity_data.csv)
- Software: tensorflow 2.7.0, scikit-learn 1.0.2, Python 3.7.10, Conda 4.10.3, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0, Visual Studio Code 1.60.2
- Please see the preprocessing and training code [here](https://github.com/mthalken/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/blob/main/AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb).
- Please see the optimized code [here](https://github.com/mthalken/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/blob/main/AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb).

## Results 
### The analysis
- What are two conclusions you can draw?

- What can you conclude?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
